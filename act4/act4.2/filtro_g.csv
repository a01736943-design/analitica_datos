My spouse, our kids, and I have traveled in the North, South, and Central America, Europe, Middle East, and Asia so far. We love to discover different cultures and meet people from these beautiful, lovely, and nice societies. 

We would be very much happy to host you in our lovely, warm, and friendly place which is disinfected and cleaned properly all the time. Please feel free to interact with us, share your experience, tell us your stories and be part of ""the moment"" that could give all of us a different point of view about each other, our wonderful planet, and life! 

We tend to give privacy to our guests, so feel free to let us know if you would like to get in touch in person. We are more than happy to say hi in person. 

You are more than welcome to be part of our neighborhood by following CDC's health requirements due to the COVID-19 pandemic, respectfully!

This career path gave me the freedom to control my time and hence I was able to travel internationally at least a few times a year, I've been to over 15 countries across four continents, the pace's just too slow. I love staying at Airbnb to get local tips, make new friends, and as a way for me to enrich my global experience without physically traveling there, I want to become a host as well. Boston is a tourist destination for many reasons, and in Cambridge, I meet many intelligent, fun, and creative people all around the world. I hope to be a host and local guide for those who visiting Cambridge and Boston.
