New England is a great place to visit so I look forward to meeting you soon!

A little bit about me…
Originally from Florida, I found my way to New England via Spain where I lived and worked for 10 years! I have resided in Cambridge for the past 16 years and love everything it has to offer. I know the city well and can give you tips on things to do, places to see, and where to eat! 

My partner, Steve, and I are both retired from the education field. I was a Spanish teacher and he retired as a library director. We love to travel, cook, and spend time with friends and family.

I recently decided to turn my beautiful peice of property into a place where visitors can come and enjoy all this wonderful city has to offer while staying in a place of history vs a hotel!  You will enjoy staying here and all this city has to offer_ I will make sure of it!  :)

I love staying at Airbnb to get local tips, make new friends, and as a way for me to enrich my global experience without physically traveling there, I want to become a host as well. Boston is a tourist destination for many reasons, and in Cambridge, I meet many intelligent, fun, and creative people all around the world. I hope to be a host and local guide for those who visiting Cambridge and Boston.

I used to bike from Harvard to MIT when I was a student, a very pleasant 15 minute ride. Harvard Street is just two streets north of Massachusetts Avenue, which is the main street that connects these school and also directly leads to downtown.

This career path gave me the freedom to control my time and hence I was able to travel internationally at least a few times a year, I've been to over 15 countries across four continents, the pace's just too slow. I love staying at Airbnb to get local tips, make new friends, and as a way for me to enrich my global experience without physically traveling there, I want to become a host as well. Boston is a tourist destination for many reasons, and in Cambridge, I meet many intelligent, fun, and creative people all around the world. I hope to be a host and local guide for those who visiting Cambridge and Boston.

I truly enjoy hosting Airbnb and I think it's a great community of people, almost like a world web of great hosts and guests.
As for me I'm very sociable person and Airbnb gives me an opportunity to meet different people each time.
I also like to keep things clean and organized and spend most of my time reading books, doing research on a healthy lifestyle and of course trying to live one! :)
